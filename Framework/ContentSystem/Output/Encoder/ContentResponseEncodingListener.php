/**
 * Where a content response stops being a struct the framework encodes and becomes a body the module wrote.
 *
 * It encodes, and nothing else. The selection is by response class: the four format responses share
 * {@see AbstractContentRouteResponse}, while route scope and route name discriminate neither.
 *
 * FIELD SELECTION IS REFUSED, not filtered here. A request carrying `includes` or `excludes` never reaches a
 * response at all: {@see ContentRoute::load()} rejects it with a 400 at request admission, so this listener
 * touches no parameter bag and every content body it produces is unfiltered by construction.
 *
 * THREE FORMATS ARE REPLACED by a carrier bearing the module's own body — full, decomposed and data — each
 * through its own encoder. Status and headers are copied across explicitly, because a channel-api response holds
 * its payload as a constructor-injected struct and has no setter for it. The skeleton format is deliberately
 * not among them: it is homogeneous, carries no entity payloads, and so keeps passing through the framework
 * encoder as a plain struct.
 *
 * The encoder is chosen by an explicit `match` over three concrete collaborators rather than through a common
 * interface. That keeps it greppable from here which encoder produced which format's body; an interface would
 * put a `->encode()` call in its place and hide exactly that.
 *
 * The priority sits strictly between the two neighbours that must keep their order around this: SEO-URL
 * enrichment above, the framework's channel-api encoding below. Both take their priority from their own
 * `getSubscribedEvents()`, not from configuration. Running above the encoder is what makes the swap happen
 * before the route's `.encode` event, so an `.encode` listener observes the carrier.
 *
